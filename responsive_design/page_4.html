            <h2>What is resurreccion</h2>
            <p>resurreccion is a power that can only be used by arrancar and espada. Seance the espada and arrancar are hollows who have become soul reaoers unlike soul reapers who use shikai and banaki the espada and arrancar use there resurreccion this brings them back to orgianl hollow form which was sealed into thier swords and just like a soul reapers zanpakuto has a release comand for thier shikai the espada and arrancar have a relase command for thier resurreccion some exaples of this are "grind pantera", "kick about los lobos", "emprison murcielago" when these release calls are maid the espada or arrancar returnes back to there origianl state and giving them and increase in power as well.  </p>

            <h3>What is Segunda etapa</h3>
            <p>Segunda etapa is the second relase of an espada but this is hard to say if all espada can achieve this second release because the only one know to achieve this second relase state is espada #4 Ulquiorra cifer he is only one of all the espada that can achieve a second release state when ever Ulquiorra enters into this state he becomes more primal and anamalistic which is the opposite of his character who is usualy more calm and composed has become more violeant and ananmlistic which means that this secod relases state not only gives the user and even larger boost in power but becomes much more violet in natuer make the segunda etapa a very danger second relase for an espada. the release command for this second state is resurreccion segunda etapa this is release comand for the the second release state of an arrancar. </p>
