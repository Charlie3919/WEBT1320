            <h2>What is Bankai</h2>
            <p>Bankai is the third release of a zanpakuto to achieve a bankai is much more diffcult to achieve because for many soul reapers it takes 10 years to achieve a bankai and then another 10 years after that to master. But even thought it is very diffcult to achieve when a soul reaper achieves a banaki they gain more power and some new abilitys that can only be accessed by menas of bankai and just like shikai each bankai is very uneach some bankai look the same as thier shikai but gain much more power other look complety diffrent then thier shikai for example Benihime bankai transforms from a sword to a giant puppet like woman in a red dress and also the owners sealed sword this bankai gives the owner the power of recinstuction this means that if something is broken the owner can fix it with is power but it only last for the time that the bankai is activated there are many benifites to having a banaki but it is very difficult to obtain one. </p>

            <h3>how to achieve Bankai</h3>
            <p>To achieve a bankai a soul reaper must subsigate thier zanpakuto inorder to achieve bankai which is what makes obtaing a bankai so difficult to do. But Kisuke Urahara created a divice that can take this proces that takes 10 years to achieve and bring it down to only 3 days this envention is called Tenshintai "divine transfer body" a soul reaper stabis this divice and thier zanpakuto manfestion forms is brought to the real world this will help make the procees easyer instead of having to go to the inerworld to try and achieve this proces is easayer but also more diffcult becuase a soul reaper still need subsigate thier zanpakuto using the divice sould only take 3 days any more and it can be very dangers these are the metihdas to achive a bankai.  </p>
