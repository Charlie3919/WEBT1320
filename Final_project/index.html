        <h2>The 4 races</h2>
        <p>The bleach series has 4 diffrent races 2 of these races are not human andf the other 2 can be classified as super humans in a seance. One of the main things that seperates these 4 races from humans is that these 4 races have special powers and ablitys but also some of the races are invisble to ordinary humans some humans can see these other races but this is a very small few number of people who have a large amount of spiritual preaser this can help them be able to see the 2 races that are invisible to ordinary people. Each one of these races has there own uneach power that are availible only to them and each of them lives in a diffrent world two of the races live on earth because they are normal humans with special powers and the other two live in a completyly difffrent world that is not earth. </p>
