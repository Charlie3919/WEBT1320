                <p>Quincy are humans that have special power this allows them to see hollows and soul reapers becuase to normal humans soul reapers and hollows and invisble to ordinary humans. All quincy got thier power from Yhwach the fater of all Quincys he is also the son of the soul king. Unlike soul reapers when a quincy defeats a hollow they do not purify the soul they destroy it completyly and because of this it cause an inbalce in the worlds and this is what casue for the soul reapers to have to eliminate the quincy so that the balance could be restored. quincy primary wepon is a bow and arow made of spirt energy.</p>
